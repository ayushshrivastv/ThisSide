# ThisSide
There are countless moments when you wish you could check in on a family memberâ€”just to know theyâ€™ve arrived safely. But life gets busy, communication slips through the cracks, and that simple reassurance isnâ€™t always easy to get.

Thatâ€™s why I created ThisSide.

I know what itâ€™s like to feel that pang of worry when a loved one doesnâ€™t respond, the uncertainty of not knowing where they are, and the longing for reassurance that theyâ€™re safe. ThisSide isnâ€™t just about tracking locationsâ€”itâ€™s about staying connected, feeling close, and giving peace of mind, no matter where life takes us.

Iâ€™ve developed ThisSide, As my submission for the Swift Student Challenge 2025.
